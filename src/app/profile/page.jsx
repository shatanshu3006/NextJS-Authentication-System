        Here are some key features and aspects of Next.js:

Server-side Rendering (SSR): Next.js allows you to render React components on the server side before sending them to the client. This improves SEO and initial load performance by providing a fully rendered page to the client.
Static Siides automatic image optimization, including lazy loading and progressive image loading, to improve performance.
Deployment: Next.js applications can be deployed to various hosting platforms, including Vercel (which was created by the same team behind Next.js), AWS, Netlify, and more.
